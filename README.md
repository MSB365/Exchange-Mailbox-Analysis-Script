2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\\Exchange-MailboxAnalysis.ps1
   ```
4. Select your CSV file when the file dialog opens
5. Monitor progress in the console
6. Find generated reports in the same directory as your CSV file

### Output Files
The script generates timestamped files:
- `MailboxAnalysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html` - Formatted HTML report

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**EWS Managed API Not Found**
```
Error: EWS Managed API not found
Solution: Install Exchange Web Services Managed API 2.2 from Microsoft
```

**Permission Denied**
```
Error: Access denied to mailbox
Solution: Ensure account has ApplicationImpersonation rights
```

**Exchange Management Shell Not Loaded**
```
Error: Exchange cmdlets not available
Solution: Run script from Exchange Management Shell, not regular PowerShell
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Mailboxes**: Processing may take longer for mailboxes with many messages
- **Network Latency**: EWS calls depend on network connectivity to Exchange server
- **Throttling**: Exchange may throttle EWS requests for large batch operations


### Development Guidelines
1. Follow PowerShell best practices
2. Include error handling for new features
3. Update documentation for any new functionality
4. Test with different Exchange versions when possible
